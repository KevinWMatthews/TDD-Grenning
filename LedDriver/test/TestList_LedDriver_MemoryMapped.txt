		Memory Mapped LED Driver Tests

Convert to dynamic interface
~Destroy function in interface?
~Put create in each driver.
~Look into includes. Should MemoryMapped include LedDriver?
~Test memory mapped driver type in base: self->base.driverType = "MemoryMapped";

~Make all functions handle null pointers


~All LEDs off after the driver is initialized
~Can turn on a single LED
~Can turn off a single LED
~Can turn on multiple LEDs
Can turn off multiple LEDs
~Can turn on all LEDs
~Can turn off all LEDs
~Query LED state
~Check boundary values
	~Beyond max breaks nothing
	~Under min breaks nothing
	Runtime Error
	What should really happen?
~Hardware interaction
	Oh, really? Hahaha...

Go back and implement runtime error stub (pg 88)
Go back and impelment executable reminders (ignoring tests) (pg 90)
Use my data types
Look into C++ keywords true and false
Look into BOOL enum/type
